abstract = {When navigating a spacecraft between planets, moons and orbits, low-energy transfer orbits allows us to make the trade-off of a longer flight time in return for lower propel- lant energy requirements, suitable for unmanned space missions. Based on the restricted 3-body model and using second-order adaptive symplectic integrators inplemented par- allelized in Python, we brute-force search in many directions- and velocities from low Earth orbit for transfer orbits to the Moon. The lowest-energy orbit we found to the moon has ∆v = 3795 km/s and takes 194 days, which is even better than typical values in the literrature. Our model and implementation is validated by simulating the Apollo mission's 3-day Hohmann transfer-orbit to the Moon, found to agree within 2.5{\%}.},

@article{Zegler2010,
abstract = {Substantial amounts of work have been expended in the past years evaluating the benefits of propellant depots for Lunar exploration. The advantages of these depots are enormous and they provide unmatched performance and reliability benefits once the technology is matured. However the maturation process itself represents a significant challenge. In a cost-constrained environment a step-wise and evolutionary approach to the development of this critical technology is optimal. Such an approach takes on risks in smaller, less costly increments. A foundational functionality is achieved as early as possible- enabling learning by direct experience. Subsequent steps benefit from concrete data and design refinements. The proposed evolution plan utilizes existing launchers and upper stages coupled with orbital test beds to move from the theoretical position of today to a depot design founded on test data but using existing aerostructures, tanks and equipment. The benefits of this very basic LEO depot as well as subsequent L1 or L2 based depots are shown for missions other than lunar landings. These range from robotic advanced capability probes to virtually anywhere in the solar system to more ambitious manned missions to near earth asteroids and the moon. With the technique of orbital propellant transfer secured by years of experience a practical architecture for indefinite stay Martian exploration can be readily envisaged as a direct extension ??? ?????? ?????????????????? ?????????????? ???????????? ???????? ????? ??????-stage-to-orbit vehicles that can reenter without significant aerobraking are practical. Mars orbital propellant depots coupled to these SSTO vehicles enables a strategy of global reconnaissance and exploration. I.},

@article{Salimans2017,
abstract = {We explore the use of Evolution Strategies (ES), a class of black box optimization algorithms, as an alternative to popular MDP-based RL techniques such as Q-learning and Policy Gradients. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari show that ES is a viable solution strategy that scales extremely well with the number of CPUs available: By using a novel communication strategy based on common random numbers, our ES implementation only needs to communicate scalars, making it possible to scale to over a thousand parallel workers. This allows us to solve 3D humanoid walking in 10 minutes and obtain competitive results on most Atari games after one hour of training. In addition, we highlight several advantages of ES as a black box optimization technique: it is invariant to action frequency and delayed rewards, tolerant of extremely long horizons, and does not need temporal discounting or value function approximation.},

abstract = {While there are many challenges involved in planning human missions to Mars, the problems involved in launching, transporting, landing and returning large masses to and from these bodies appear to be perhaps the most formidable of these hurdles. Propulsion systems are utilized in trans-Mars injection from LEO, Mars orbit insertion, entry, descent and landing at Mars, ascent to Mars orbit, Trans-Earth injection, and entry, descent and landing at Earth. For any specific transfer there is an associated {\$}\Delta{\$}v. The propulsion system dry mass and specific impulse can be used to calculate the mass of propellants needed to transfer a payload for any {\$}\Delta{\$}v. Using an ideal model with circular Earth and Mars orbits, approximate values of {\$}\Delta{\$}v can be estimated for Earth departure and Mars orbit insertion. More realistic models were developed by JPL. Propellant requirements are estimated for various steps in a human mission to Mars using chemical propulsion or nuclear thermal propulsion. Gear ratios {\{}(initial mass)/(delivered payload mass){\}} for each step are analyzed. Solar electric propulsion for Earth orbit-raising is reviewed. Ascent from the Mars surface is analyzed in detail. Propellant requirements for ascent are estimated in detail.},
