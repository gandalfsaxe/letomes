abstract = {A method is described to construct trajectories from the Earth to the Moon which utilizes the existence of Lunar capture orbits and the concept of 'stability boundary'. These orbits are ballistic and represent a new family of trajectories. They go into orbit about the Moon from a suitable position about the Earth with no required thrusting. This method is applied to a mission being studied at JPL called Lunar GAS (Get Away Special). Other Applications are discussed.},

abstract = {When navigating a spacecraft between planets, moons and orbits, low-energy transfer orbits allows us to make the trade-off of a longer flight time in return for lower propel- lant energy requirements, suitable for unmanned space missions. Based on the restricted 3-body model and using second-order adaptive symplectic integrators inplemented par- allelized in Python, we brute-force search in many directions- and velocities from low Earth orbit for transfer orbits to the Moon. The lowest-energy orbit we found to the moon has ∆v = 3795 km/s and takes 194 days, which is even better than typical values in the literrature. Our model and implementation is validated by simulating the Apollo mission's 3-day Hohmann transfer-orbit to the Moon, found to agree within 2.5{\%}.},

abstract = {We explore the use of Evolution Strategies (ES), a class of black box optimization algorithms, as an alternative to popular MDP-based RL techniques such as Q-learning and Policy Gradients. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari show that ES is a viable solution strategy that scales extremely well with the number of CPUs available: By using a novel communication strategy based on common random numbers, our ES implementation only needs to communicate scalars, making it possible to scale to over a thousand parallel workers. This allows us to solve 3D humanoid walking in 10 minutes and obtain competitive results on most Atari games after one hour of training. In addition, we highlight several advantages of ES as a black box optimization technique: it is invariant to action frequency and delayed rewards, tolerant of extremely long horizons, and does not need temporal discounting or value function approximation.},

They introduce students to the increasingly important role that nonlinearities play in contemporary applications of classical mechanics.

abstract = {While there are many challenges involved in planning human missions to Mars, the problems involved in launching, transporting, landing and returning large masses to and from these bodies appear to be perhaps the most formidable of these hurdles. Propulsion systems are utilized in trans-Mars injection from LEO, Mars orbit insertion, entry, descent and landing at Mars, ascent to Mars orbit, Trans-Earth injection, and entry, descent and landing at Earth. For any specific transfer there is an associated {\$}\Delta{\$}v. The propulsion system dry mass and specific impulse can be used to calculate the mass of propellants needed to transfer a payload for any {\$}\Delta{\$}v. Using an ideal model with circular Earth and Mars orbits, approximate values of {\$}\Delta{\$}v can be estimated for Earth departure and Mars orbit insertion. More realistic models were developed by JPL. Propellant requirements are estimated for various steps in a human mission to Mars using chemical propulsion or nuclear thermal propulsion. Gear ratios {\{}(initial mass)/(delivered payload mass){\}} for each step are analyzed. Solar electric propulsion for Earth orbit-raising is reviewed. Ascent from the Mars surface is analyzed in detail. Propellant requirements for ascent are estimated in detail.},

abstract = {Substantial amounts of work have been expended in the past years evaluating the benefits of propellant depots for Lunar exploration. The advantages of these depots are enormous and they provide unmatched performance and reliability benefits once the technology is matured. However the maturation process itself represents a significant challenge. In a cost-constrained environment a step-wise and evolutionary approach to the development of this critical technology is optimal. Such an approach takes on risks in smaller, less costly increments. A foundational functionality is achieved as early as possible- enabling learning by direct experience. Subsequent steps benefit from concrete data and design refinements. The proposed evolution plan utilizes existing launchers and upper stages coupled with orbital test beds to move from the theoretical position of today to a depot design founded on test data but using existing aerostructures, tanks and equipment. The benefits of this very basic LEO depot as well as subsequent L1 or L2 based depots are shown for missions other than lunar landings. These range from robotic advanced capability probes to virtually anywhere in the solar system to more ambitious manned missions to near earth asteroids and the moon. With the technique of orbital propellant transfer secured by years of experience a practical architecture for indefinite stay Martian exploration can be readily envisaged as a direct extension ??? ?????? ?????????????????? ?????????????? ???????????? ???????? ????? ??????-stage-to-orbit vehicles that can reenter without significant aerobraking are practical. Mars orbital propellant depots coupled to these SSTO vehicles enables a strategy of global reconnaissance and exploration. I.},

@techreport{Belbuno1990,
abstract = {The purpose of this memo is to document two integrated trajectories which go from the present elliptic orbit for the Hiten S/C to ballistic lunar capture at a periapsis altitude of 100 km requiring between 30 m/s – 169 m/s. This is within the propellant budget which is approximately 250 m/s. Because of this constraint, the trajectories are nonlinear and are found by utilizing the nonlinear four-body interaction between the Sun-Earth-Moon-S/C. Approximately four months are required to transfer from the present Hiten S/C orbit to ballistic lunar capture. The captured orbit needs to be stabilized. The trajectories are generated with DPTRAJ. The construction of trajectories with more current mission data and time frames is in progress.},

@techreport{Wierstra2011,
abstract = {This paper presents Natural Evolution Strategies (NES), a recent family of algorithms that constitute a more principled approach to black-box optimization than established evolutionary algorithms. NES maintains a parameterized distribution on the set of solution candidates, and the natural gradient is used to update the distribution's parameters in the direction of higher expected fitness. We introduce a collection of techniques that address issues of convergence, robustness, sample complexity, computational complexity and sensitivity to hyperparameters. This paper explores a number of implementations of the NES family, ranging from general-purpose multi-variate normal distributions to heavy-tailed and separable distributions tailored towards global optimization and search in high dimensional spaces, respectively. Experimental results show best published performance on various standard benchmarks, as well as competitive performance on others.},

@article{Sanchez-Sanchez2016,
abstract = {Recent research on deep learning, a set of machine learning techniques able to learn deep architectures, has shown how robotic perception and action greatly benefits from these techniques. In terms of spacecraft navigation and control system, this suggests that deep architectures may be considered now to drive all or part of the on-board decision making system. In this paper this claim is investigated in more detail training deep artificial neural networks to represent the optimal control action during a pinpoint landing, assuming perfect state information. It is found to be possible to train deep networks for this purpose and that the resulting landings, driven by the trained networks, are close to simulated optimal ones. These results allow for the design of an on-board real time optimal control system able to cope with large sets of possible initial states while still producing an optimal response.},
