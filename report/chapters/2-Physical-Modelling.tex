\chapter{Physical Modelling}
We need a chapter to formulate our hypotheses, and generally give a before-the-fact run-down of what the project and report will be like.

\section{3-body System (Earth-Moon)}
\subsection{Errors Found in Old BSc Code}
We found some mathematical errors in the old code; argue for why they donâ€™t invalidate the old results

\subsection{Equations of Motion}

\subsection{Numerical Algorithm}

\section{4-body System (Sun-Earth-Mars)}
