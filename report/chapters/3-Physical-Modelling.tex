\chapter{Physical Modelling}
We will model two systems:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 2D simulator for Earth-Moon system (cartesian coordinates, center-of-mass-centered).
	\item 3D simulator for Sun-Earth-Moon system (spherical coordinates, heliocentric)
\end{enumerate}

We will derive equations of motion using Hamiltonian mechanics, shortly describe symplectic integrators and integrate the equations of motion using symplectic integrators to obtain numerical algorithms.

Finally we will proceed to describe the complexities of Earth-Mars transfer orbits, a simplified Earth-Mars transfer orbit with patched conic approximation.

\section{Analytical Mechanics}
Newton's 2nd Law is a very well known physical law of classical mechanics governing all bodies having mass. It can be stated \cite{Knudsen2002}
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:newton2}
    \textbf{Newton's 2nd Law} \qquad \sum{\vec{F}} = \dfrac{d \vec{p}}{dt}.
\end{align}

where the left-hand side is the total force on the body and the right-hand side is the time derivative of the momentum vector defined as mass times the velocity vector \(\vec{p} = m \vec{v}\).

However we will use the more powerful Hamiltonian formalism from the field of analytical mechanics, which is \cite{Knudsen2002}

\begin{align}
\textbf{Generalized momenta} \qquad p_i(\vec{q},\dot{\vec{q}}) &= \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q_i}}, \qquad i = 1,\cdots, n \ , \label{eq:generalized-momenta} \\[1cm]
\textbf{Hamiltonian} \qquad H(\vec{q}, \vec{p}, t) &= \sum\limits_{i=1}^n p_i \dot{q_i} - L \label{eq:hamiltonian}, \\[1cm]
\textbf{Hamilton's equations} \qquad
\begin{split}
\label{eq:hamiltons-equations}
\dot{q_i} &= +\dfrac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} ,
\\[0.2cm]
\dot{p_i} &= -\dfrac{\partial H}{\partial q_i}.
\end{split}
\end{align}
where $q_i$ and $p_i$ are the coordinates and the generalized momenta respectively, one for each degree of freedom, $i$ is the index of degrees of freedom (e.g. $x, y$ for a 2D cartesian coordinates or  $r, \theta, \phi$ for a 3D spherical coordinates), $n$ is the total degrees of freedom, $\dot{q}$ is the time-derivative of $q$, $L = T - V$ is the Lagrangian with $T$ being the system's kinetic energy and $V$ it's potential energy. The Hamiltonian, \cref{eq:hamiltonian} corresponds to the total mechanical energy of the system\footnote{For most physical systems with some exceptions, see \cref{ch:HvsE} for details} and \cref{eq:hamiltons-equations} constitutes the equations of motion, and when solved give the solutions $\vec{q}(t)$, $\vec{p}(t)$.

The reason for using Hamiltonian's equations instead of Newton's is primarily that it yields $2 n$ first order differential equations of motion for $n$ degrees of freedom (dimensions), where as Newton's 2nd Law yields $n$ 2nd order differential equations. As it turns out, first-order differential equations are more straight forward to discretize, i.e. turn into a numerical algorithm that can be typed into a computer program.

For a guide on how to use Hamilton's formalism in practice, see \cref{apx:using-hamilton-mechanics}.

\section{Numerical Algorithms}
Once we have derived our equations of motion in the form of Hamilton's equations \cref{eq:hamiltons-equations}, we need to solve them. In 1887 and 1889, mathematicians Heinrich Bruns and Henri Poincaré showed that there is no general analytical solution to the three-body problem given by simple algebraic expressions and integrals \cite{Gowers2008}. This means have have to solve them numerically to get time time evolution of the coordinates and velocity for particular initial conditions and delta-v impulses.

\subsection{Symplectic Integrators}
Symplectic integrators are a class of integrators typically used in Hamiltonian systems that have the property that they preserve the energy very well over longer time. Informally, ``\textit{a symplectic map is a map which preserves the sum of areas projected onto the set of $(p_i,q_i)$ planes. It is the generalization of an area-preserving map}'' \cite{Weisstein}, as illustrated in \cref{fig:symplectic-area}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.90\linewidth]{fig/symplectic-area.png}
    \caption{Area preservation in phase space (corresponding to preservation of the Hamiltonian, $H$), for various symplectic numerical methods for a pendulum (Image: \cite{Hairer})}
    \label{fig:symplectic-area}
\end{figure}

Thus symplectic algorithms have been employed in fields such as molecular dynamics and astronomy. ``\textit{Symplectic methods belong to the larger class of geometric numerical integration algorithms. These algorithms are constructed so that they preserve certain geometrical properties inherent in the system. Symplectic methods are so named because, when applied to problems in Hamiltonian mechanics, the algorithms preserve the linear symplectic structure inherent in the phase space representation of the dynamics.}'' \cite{Donnelly2005}. We therefore only use Symplectic integrators for our equations.


\subsubsection{Symplectic Euler (1st Order Method)}
In the explicit Euler, all quantities from the Hamiltonian derivative on the right hand refer to the old time step $i$ (index 0). In the implicit, all quantities on the RHS refers to the new time step $i+1$ (index 1), which results in implicit equations that can typically only be solved numerically.

The 1st order symplectic Euler is mixture between explicit and implicit Euler \cite{Hairer}:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split} \label{eq:symplectic-euler1}
        \vec{q}_1 = \vec{q}_0 + h \pd{H}{\vec{p}}(q_0, p_1) \\
        \vec{p}_1 = \vec{p}_0 - h \pd{H}{\vec{q}}(q_0, p_1)
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

or

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split} \label{eq:symplectic-euler2}
        \vec{q}_1 = \vec{q}_0 + h \pd{H}{\vec{p}}(q_1, p_0) \\
        \vec{p}_1 = \vec{p}_0 - h \pd{H}{\vec{q}}(q_1, p_0)
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Symplectic Störmer-Verlet (2nd Order Method)}

The 2nd order symplectic Störmer-Verlet (henceforth simply called Verlet) is given by \cite{Hairer}:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split} \label{eq:symplectic-verlet1}
        \vec{p}_{1/2} &= \vec{p}_0 - \frac{h}{2} \pd{H}{\vec{q}}(q_0, p_{1/2}) \\
        \vec{q}_1 &= \vec{q}_0 + \frac{h}{2} \left( \pd{H}{\vec{p}}(q_0, p_{1/2}) + \pd{H}{\vec{p}}(q_1, p_{1/2}) \right) \\
        \vec{p}_{1} &= \vec{p}_{1/2} - \frac{h}{2} \pd{H}{\vec{q}}(q_1, p_{1/2}) \\
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

or

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split} \label{eq:symplectic-verlet2}
        \vec{q}_{1/2} &= \vec{q}_0 + \frac{h}{2} \pd{H}{\vec{p}}(q_{1/2}, p_0) \\
        \vec{p}_1 &= \vec{p}_0 - \frac{h}{2} \left( \pd{H}{\vec{q}}(q_{1/2}, p_0) + \pd{H}{\vec{q}}(q_{1/2}, p_1) \right) \\
        \vec{q}_{1} &= \vec{q}_{1/2} + \frac{h}{2} \pd{H}{\vec{p}}(q_{1/2}, p_1) \\
    \end{split}
\end{equation}



\section{CM-Centered Restricted 3-Body System (C-R3B), Earth-Moon}
The center-of-mass-centered 3-body system (C-R3B) with the Earth and Moon was explored in \cite{Saxe2015}; refer to this for detailed derivations of C-R3B. We will present the final nondimensionalized equations of motion, and numerical integration algorithms for reference. The model is set up as in \cref{fig:r3b}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig/r3b.pdf}
    \caption{Restricted three-body problem. Two coordinate systems both with center of mass as origin: $(\mathscr{X},\mathscr{Y})$ is a stationary inertial frame, $(x,y)$ is a co-rotating non-inertial frame that rotates with the moon at angular frequency $\omega$. $M =$ mass of Earth, $m =$ mass of Moon, $\vec{R} =$ vector from CM to earth, $\vec{r} =$ vector from CM to Moon, $m_s =$ mass of spacecraft, $r_{S,E} =$ distance from spacecraft to Earth, $r_{S,M} =$ distance from spacecraft to Moon. In the dimensionless variables we introduce later, unit distance is $R+r$, which makes the dimensionless constant $k = \text{the CM-Earth distance} = \dfrac{R}{R+r} = $ and $1-k = \text{the CM-Moon distance} = \dfrac{r}{R+r}$ (Image: \cite{Saxe2015}).}
    \label{fig:r3b}
\end{figure}

\subsection{C-R3B Equations of Motion}

\begin{empheq}[box=\widefbox]{align}
\label{eq:Xdot}
\dot{X} = P_x + Y
\end{empheq}

\begin{empheq}[box=\widefbox]{align}
\label{eq:Ydot}
\dot{Y} = P_Y - X
\end{empheq}

\begin{empheq}[box=\widefbox]{align}
\label{eq:Pdot_X}
\dot{P}_X = P_Y - \dfrac{(1-k)(X+k)}{((X+k)^2+Y^2)^{3/2}} - \dfrac{k(X-1+k))}{((X-1+k))^2+Y^2)^{3/2}}
\end{empheq}

\begin{empheq}[box=\widefbox]{align}
\label{eq:Pdot_Y}
\dot{P}_Y = -P_X - \dfrac{(1-k)Y}{((X+k)^2+Y^2)^{3/2}} - \dfrac{k Y}{((X-1+k))^2+Y^2)^{3/2}}
\end{empheq}
where \(T\), \(X\), \(Y\), \(P_x\) and \(P_y\) are our dimensionless variables for time, positions, generalized impulse, and \(k=\dfrac{M_{\Moon}}{M_{\Earth} + M_{\Moon}}\), that is the ratio of Moon's mass to the total Earth and Moon mass.

\subsection{C-R3B Numerical Algorithms}
\subsubsection{C-R3B Symplectic Euler}
We refer to \cite{Saxe2015} for detailed derivations. The equations of motion of the other system in the next section will be derived in details. Based on \cref{eq:Xdot,eq:Ydot,eq:Pdot_X,eq:Pdot_Y}, a symplectic Euler algorithm is found:

\begin{align}
    X_1 &= \dfrac{X_0 + h (h P_{Y,0} + P_{X,0} + Y_0)}{1+h^2}, \\[0.4cm]
    Y_1 &= Y_0 + h (P_{Y,0} - X_1), \label{eq:symplectic-euler-Y_1}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    \begin{aligned}
        P_{X,1} &= P_{X,0} \\
        &+ h \left(P_{Y,0} - \dfrac{(1-k)(k+X_1)}{((k+X_1)^2+Y_1^2)^{3/2}} + \dfrac{k(X_1-1+k)}{((X_1-1+k)^2+Y_1^2)^{3/2}}\right), \label{eq:symplectic-euler-PX_1}
    \end{aligned} \\[0.4cm]
    \begin{aligned}
        P_{Y,1} &= P_{Y,0} \\
        &+ h \left(-P_{X,0} - \dfrac{(1-k)Y_1}{((k+X_1)^2+Y_1^2)^{3/2}} - \dfrac{k Y_1}{((X_1-1+k)^2+Y_1^2)^{3/2}}\right), \label{eq:symplectic-euler-PY_1}
    \end{aligned}
\end{align}
where \(h\) is the step size, index \(0\) designates previous time step ($i$) and index \(1\) designates new time step ($i+1$). The algorithm is run in the same order as listed above.

\subsubsection{C-R3B Symplectic Störmer-Verlet}
Based on \cref{eq:Xdot,eq:Ydot,eq:Pdot_X,eq:Pdot_Y}, a symplectic Störmer-Verlet algorithm was also found (For detailed derivation, see \cite{Saxe2015}):

\begin{align}
    X_{1/2} &= \frac{h^2 P_{Y,0} + 2 h \dot{P}_{x,0} + 4 X_0}{4 + h^2} \label{eq:verlet-x_1/2} \\
    Y_{1/2} &= Y_0 + \dfrac{h}{2} (P_{Y,0} - X_{1/2}), \label{eq:verlet-y_1/2} \\
    P_{X,1} &= \frac{h^2 (2 \dot{P}_{Y,0} + P_{X,0}) + 4 h \dot{P}_{X,0} + 4 P_{X,0} }{4 + h^2} \label{eq:verlet-px_1} \\
    P_{Y,1} &= P_{Y,0} + \dfrac{h}{2} \left[-\dot{P}_Y(q_{1/2},p_0) -\dot{P}_Y(q_{1/2},p_1) \right], \label{eq:verlet-py_1} \\
    X_1 &= X_{1/2} + \dfrac{h}{2} (P_{X,1} + Y_{1/2}), \label{eq:verlet-x_1} \\
    Y_1 &= Y_{1/2} + \dfrac{h}{2} (P_{Y,1} - X_{1/2}), \label{eq:verlet-y_1}
\end{align}
where \(\dot{P}_X,\dot{P}_Y\) are \cref{eq:Pdot_X,eq:Pdot_Y}, \(h\) is the step size, index \(0\) designates previous time step ($i$) and \(1\) designates new time step ($i+1$). The algorithm is run in the same order as listed above.

\subsubsection{Adaptive Timesteps}
Furthermore the Verlet algorithm is made to take adaptive time steps. In areas relatively large accelerations, the step size is decreased and vice versa. The idea is to take both an Euler and a Verlet step, and estimate the error made in the step as the difference between the two.

Let $z$ denote a vector of the position variables $(X,y)$.
\begin{align}
\text{Euler step result:} \qquad z_1 = z + O(h), \\
\text{Verlet step result:} \qquad z_2 = z + O(h^2), \\
\end{align}
where O(h) denotes an error term of order h. Then we take the difference
\begin{align}
\|z_1 - z_2\| &= O(h) - O(h^2) \\
&\approx O(h)\ ,
\end{align}
since $O(h) \gg O(h^2)$. Thus we approximate the error difference between the Euler and Verlet method as the actual error we make at step size $h$. The idea is to make both an Euler and a Verlet step for every time-step to assess the error and adjust the step size accordingly. For every single step the step size is changed either up or down, depending on the errors and tolerance. As a result we always stay near the same error in every step, only taking as small steps as necessary in each iteration.

The non-adaptive algorithm is fixed in step size but varies in error per step.
The adaptive algorithm varies in step size in an attempt to fix the error per step.

For all simulations we have set $10^{-9}$ as the maximum tolerated error per step in the adaptive algorithm. For the non-adaptive algorithm we select a fixed step size, $10^{-6}$, to ensure that it's reasonably low most of the time. This approach was again taken directly from \cite{Saxe2015}.

\section{Heliocentric Restricted 4-Body System (H-R4B), Sun-Earth-Mars}
Simulating orbit from Earth to Mars requires a new model with at least four bodies: Sun, Earth, Mars and the Spacecraft. The coordinate system will be heliocentric and in spherical coordinates, and restricted\footnote{Meaning that the mass of the spacecraft is considered negligible compared to compared to the celestial masses and therefore is assumed not to affect them}, so we call this system the ``Heliocentric Restricted 4-Body System'', see \cref{fig:solar-system-model}. We will derive the equations of motion of the spacecraft by using Hamilton's equations, which gives us a set of coupled first-order differential equations, and a set of conserved quantities as ``generalized momenta''.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.80\linewidth]{fig/solar-system-model}
    \caption{ H-R4B model of spacecraft motion.The sun is assumed stationary at the origin of a spherical coordinate system, and the focus of two elliptical orbits of Earth and Mars. (Assets source: \cite{WikiSpherical,flaticon})}
    \label{fig:solar-system-model}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Spherical Coordinate System}
We adopt the spherical coordinate system which customary in astrodynamics, as shown in \cref{fig:solar-system-model}.

The coordinate transform equations to and from the cartesian coordinate system are:

\begin{align}
    x &= r \sin{\theta}\cos{\phi}, \label{eq:x(q)} \\
    y &= r \sin{\theta}\sin{\phi}, \label{eq:y(q)}\\
    z &= r \cos{\theta}, \label{eq:z(q)}
\end{align}

and

\begin{align}
    r &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}, \label{eq:r(x,y,z)}\\
    \theta &= \arccos{\frac{z}{r}}, \label{eq:theta(x,y,z)}\\
    % \arctan{\frac{y}{x}}, \qquad \theta  \in [0, 2\pi]
    \phi &= 
    \arctantwo{(y/x)} \\
    \label{eq:phi(x,y,z)}
\end{align}

where \(r \in [0, \infty]\), \(\theta \in [0, \pi]\) and \(\phi \in [0, 2\pi]\) and \(\arctan2\) denotes the two-argument version of \(\arctan\) function \footnote{\(\arctan{(a)} \in (-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})\) just takes a slope as input and give an angle in quadrant 1 and 4 only, whereas \(\arctantwo{(y,x)} \in (-\pi, \pi]\) takes both \(x\) and \(y\) which also gives the correct quadrant 1–4.}\cite{WikiAtan2}.

For the calculation of kinetic in the next section we will need the position vector, unit vectors in spherical coordinates, and the Jacobians.

The position vector in spherical coordinates is
\begin{align}
    \vec{r}(r, \theta, \phi) &= x \xhat + y \yhat + z \zhat \\
    \Leftrightarrow \vec{r}(r, \theta, \phi) &= r \sin{\theta}\cos{\phi} \xhat + r \sin{\theta}\sin{\phi} \yhat + r \cos{\theta} \zhat. \label{eq:position-vec-spherical}
\end{align}

The various coordinate derivatives of the position vector is
\begin{align}
    \pd{\vec{r}}{r} &= \sin{\theta}\cos{\phi} \xhat + \sin{\theta}\sin{\phi} \yhat + \cos{\theta} \zhat \quad &\text{and} \quad &\left| \pd{\vec{r}}{r} \right| = 1 \label{eq:position-derived-r} \\
    \pd{\vec{r}}{\theta} &= r \cos{\theta}\cos{\phi} \xhat + r \cos{\theta}\sin{\phi} \yhat - r \sin{\theta} \zhat \quad &\text{and} \quad &\left| \pd{\vec{r}}{\theta} \right| = r \label{eq:position-derived-theta} \\
    \pd{\vec{r}}{\phi} &= -r\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi} \xhat + r\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi} \zhat \quad &\text{and} \quad &\left| \pd{\vec{r}}{\phi} \right| = r\sin{\theta} \label{eq:position-derived-phi}
\end{align}

So the unit vectors in spherical coordinates are
\begin{align}
    \rhat = \dfrac{\pd{\vec{r}}{r}}{\left| \pd{\vec{r}}{r} \right| } &= \sin{\theta}\cos{\phi} \xhat + \sin{\theta}\sin{\phi} \yhat + \cos{\theta} \zhat \label{eq:r-hat}\\
    \thetahat = \dfrac{\pd{\vec{r}}{\theta}}{\left| \pd{\vec{r}}{\theta} \right| } &= \cos{\theta}\cos{\phi} \xhat + \cos{\theta}\sin{\phi} \yhat - \sin{\theta} \zhat \label{eq:theta-hat}\\
    \phihat = \dfrac{\pd{\vec{r}}{\phi}}{\left| \pd{\vec{r}}{\phi} \right| } &= -\sin{\phi} \xhat + \cos{\phi} \zhat \label{eq:phi-hat}
\end{align}

\subsection{H-R4B Equations of Motion}
We will follow the 5-step process of arriving at Hamilton's equations outlined in \cref{apx:using-hamilton-mechanics}.

\subsubsection{Step 1: Lagrangian \(L\)}
The kinetic energy of the system is
\begin{align}
    T = \frac{1}{2} m_s v^2.
\end{align}

In general the total derivative of a vector is:

\begin{align}
    \vec{v} &= \od{\vec{r}}{t} = \sum\limits_{j} \pd{\vec{r}}{q_j} \od{q_j}{t}, \\
      &= \sum\limits_{j} \left|\pd{\vec{r}}{q_j}\right| \frac{\pd{\vec{r}}{q_j}}{\left|\pd{\vec{r}}{q_j}\right|} \od{q_j}{t}, \\
      &= \sum\limits_{j} \left|\pd{\vec{r}}{q_j}\right| \od{q_j}{t} \unitvector{q}_j, \\
      &= \sum\limits_{j} \left|\pd{\vec{r}}{q_j}\right| \dot{q_j} \unitvector{q}_j,
    \end{align}

where we have used that a unit vector for any coordinate system is \(\frac{\pd{\vec{r}}{q_j}}{\left|\pd{\vec{r}}{q_j}\right|} = \unitvector{q}_j\).
We can now use the derivatives of the position vector we found earlier in \cref{eq:position-derived-r,eq:position-derived-theta,eq:position-derived-phi}, to substitute for \(\left|\pd{\vec{r}}{q_j}\right|\). We don't have to substitute in \(\unitvector{q}_j\) since our unit vectors are orthogonal, so they will yield either 0 or 1 when we square \(v\). So for the spherical coordinates we get:

\begin{align}
    \vec{v} = \dot{r}\rhat + r\dot{\theta}\thetahat + r\sin{\theta}\,\dot{\phi}\phihat
\end{align}

so

\begin{align}
    v^2 = \dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\theta}^2 + r^2\sin^2{\theta}\,\dot{\phi}^2
\end{align}

so we get

\begin{align}
    T = \frac{1}{2} m_s (\dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\theta}^2 + r^2\sin^2{\theta}\,\dot{\phi}^2).
\end{align}

The gravitational potential is \cite{WikiGravPotential}

\begin{align}
    V = -G m_s \sum\limits_{k} \frac{M_k}{\left| \vec{r} - \vec{r_k} \right|},
\end{align}
where \(i\) denotes the celestial bodies acting on the spacecraft, i.e. in our system Sun, Earth and Mars.

So we finally get the Lagrangian

\begin{align}
    L &= T - V \\
    \Leftrightarrow L &= \frac{1}{2} m_s (\dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\theta}^2 + r^2\sin^2{\theta}\,\dot{\phi}^2) + G m_s \sum\limits_{k} \frac{M_k}{\left| \vec{r} - \vec{r_k} \right|}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Step 2: Generalized Momenta \(p_j\)}
\begin{align}
    p_r &= \pd{L}{\dot{r}} = m_s \dot{r} \label{eq:pr} \\
    p_\theta &= \pd{L}{\dot{\theta}} = m_s r^2 \dot{\theta} \label{eq:ptheta} \\
    p_\phi &= \pd{L}{\dot{\phi}} = m_s r^2 \sin^2{\theta} \dot{\phi} \label{eq:pphi}
\end{align}

We recognize the three generalized momenta as linear momentum (\cref{eq:pr}) and angular momentum (\cref{eq:ptheta,eq:pphi}), respectively.

\subsubsection{Step 3: \(\dot{q} = \dot{q}_j(\vec{q}, \vec{p}, t)\)}
\begin{align}
    \dot{r} &= \frac{p_r}{m_s} \\
    \dot{\theta} &= \frac{p_\theta}{m_s r^2} \\
    \dot{\phi} &= \frac{p_\phi}{m_s r^2 \sin^2{\theta}}
\end{align}

We can now rewrite \(L\) to make it independent of \(\dot{q}\) by substituting the expressions above:

\begin{align}
    T &= \frac{1}{2} m_s (\dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\theta}^2 + r^2\sin^2{\theta}\,\dot{\phi}^2) \\
    &= \frac{1}{2} m_s \left(\frac{p_r^2}{m_s^2} + r^2\frac{p_\theta^2}{m_s^2 r^4} + r^2\sin^2{\theta}\frac{p_\phi^2}{m_s^2 r^4 \sin^4{\theta}} \right) \\
    &= \frac{p_r^2}{2 m_s} + \frac{p_\theta^2}{2 m_s r^2} + \frac{p_\phi^2}{2 m_s r^2 \sin^2{\theta}} \\
\end{align}

So using \(L = T - V\) we have

\begin{align}
    L = \frac{p_r^2}{2 m_s} + \frac{p_\theta^2}{2 m_s r^2} + \frac{p_\phi^2}{2 m_s r^2 \sin^2{\theta}} + G m_s \sum\limits_{k} \frac{M_k}{\left| \vec{r} - \vec{r_k} \right|}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Step 4: Hamiltonian \(H\)}
\begin{align}
    H(\vec{q}, \vec{p}, t) &= \sum\limits_{j}p_j \dot{q_j} - L \\
    &= \sum\limits_{j}p_j \dot{q_j}(\vec{q}, \vec{p}, t) - L \\
    &= p_r \frac{p_r}{m_s} + p_\theta \frac{p_\theta}{m_s r^2} + p_\phi + \frac{p_\phi}{m_s r^2 \sin^2{\theta}} \notag \\
    &- \left( \frac{p_r^2}{2 m_s} + \frac{p_\theta^2}{2 m_s r^2} + \frac{p_\phi^2}{2 m_s r^2 \sin^2{\theta}} + G m_s \sum\limits_{k} \frac{M_k}{\left| \vec{r} - \vec{r_k} \right|} \right) \\
    \Leftrightarrow H &= \frac{p_r^2}{2 m_s} + \frac{p_\theta^2}{2 m_s r^2} + \frac{p_\phi^2}{2 m_s r^2 \sin^2{\theta}} - G m_s \sum\limits_{k} \frac{M_k}{\left| \vec{r} - \vec{r_k} \right|}
\end{align}

At this point we want to expand the expression \(\left| \vec{r} - \vec{r_k} \right|\) in anticipation of needing to differentiate \(H\) with respect to the coordinates. Using the equations for the \(x, y, z\) coordinates \cref{eq:x(q),eq:y(q),eq:z(q)} we get

\begin{align}

\end{align}
and (colors added to show which terms factor into each other in next step)
\begin{align}
    (x-x_k)^2 &= (r\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi} - r\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi})^2 \notag \\
    &= \tikz[baseline]{
        \node[fill=orange!20,anchor=base]

        \node[fill=red!20,anchor=base]
        {\(r_k^2\sin^2{\theta_k}\cos^2{\phi_k}\)}
    } - 2r r_k \sin{\theta}\sin{\theta_k}\cos{\phi}\cos{\phi_k} \label{eq:x-dist-squared} \\
    (y-y_k)^2 &= (r\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi} - r\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi})^2 \notag \\
    &= \tikz[baseline]{

        \node[fill=red!20,anchor=base]
        {\(r_k^2\sin^2{\theta_k}\sin^2{\phi_k}\)}

    (z-z_k)^2 &= (r\cos{\theta} - r\cos{\theta})^2 \notag \\
    &= \tikz[baseline]{

    } - 2r r_k \cos{\theta}\cos{\theta_k}. \label{eq:z-dist-squared}
\end{align}
Now adding all three \cref{eq:x-dist-squared,eq:y-dist-squared,eq:z-dist-squared} the orange terms factor into \(r^2\) and the red terms factor into \(r_k^2\) and we get

\begin{align}
    d_k &= \sqrt{
        \tikz[baseline]{\node[fill=orange!20,anchor=base]{\(r^2\)}}
        + \tikz[baseline]{\node[fill=red!20,anchor=base]{\(r_k^2\)}}
        -2r r_k(\cos{\theta}\cos{\theta_k}+\sin{\theta}\sin{\theta_k}(
            \tikz[baseline]{\node[fill=blue!20,anchor=base]{
                \(\cos{\phi}\cos{\phi_k} + \sin{\phi}\sin{\phi_k}\)}}
        ))
    } \\
    &= \sqrt{r^2 + r_k^2 - 2 r r_k(\cos{\theta}\cos{\theta_k}+\sin{\theta}\sin{\theta_k}\cos{(\phi - \phi_k}))},
\end{align}
where the blue factor was simplified using the sum rule: \\
\(\cos{\alpha}\cos{\beta} + \sin{\alpha}\sin{\beta} = cos{(\alpha-\beta)}\) \cite{WeissteinTrig}.

So we can finally express \(H\) as
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        H &= \frac{p_r^2}{2 m_s} + \frac{p_\theta^2}{2 m_s r^2} + \frac{p_\phi^2}{2 m_s r^2 \sin^2{\theta}} \\
        &- G m_s \sum\limits_{k} \frac{M_k}{\sqrt{r^2 + r_k^2 - 2 r r_k \left[\cos{\theta}\cos{\theta_k}+\sin{\theta}\sin{\theta_k}\cos{(\phi - \phi_k})\right]}}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

        &+ G m_s \sum\limits_{k} M_k \frac{-r + r_k \left(\cos{\theta}\cos{\theta_k} + \sin{\theta}\sin{\theta_k}\cos{(\phi - \phi_k)}\right)}{\left[r^2 + r_k^2 - 2 r r_k \left(\cos{\theta}\cos{\theta_k} + \sin{\theta}\sin{\theta_k}\cos{(\phi - \phi_k)} \right) \right]^{3/2}} \label{eq:prdot}
    \end{split} \\[0.3cm]
    \begin{split}
        \dot{p}_\theta = -\pd{H}{\theta} &= \frac{p_\phi^2}{m_s r^2 \sin^2{\theta} \tan{\theta}} \\
        &+ G m_s \sum\limits_{k} M_k \frac{r r_k \left[-\sin{\theta}\cos{\theta_k} + \cos{\theta}\sin{\theta_k}\cos{(\phi - \phi_k)} \right]}{\left[r^2 + r_k^2 - 2 r r_k \left(\cos{\theta}\cos{\theta_k} + \sin{\theta}\sin{\theta_k}\cos{(\phi - \phi_k)} \right) \right]^{3/2}} \label{eq:pthetadot}

    \begin{split}
        \dot{p}_\phi = -\pd{H}{\phi} &= G m_s \sum\limits_{k} M_k \frac{- r r_k \sin{\theta}\sin{\theta_k}\sin{(\phi - \phi_k)}}{\left[r^2 + r_k^2 - 2 r r_k \left(\cos{\theta}\cos{\theta_k} + \sin{\theta}\sin{\theta_k}\cos{(\phi - \phi_k)} \right) \right]^{3/2}} \label{eq:pphidot}
    \end{split}
\end{align}

Those are our equations of motion. However before we try to solve them, we will remove all units.

\subsection{H-R4B Equations Nondimensionalized}
We will now choose suitable characteristic units, which has a number of benefits:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The equations gets slightly simplified
    \item The order of the effects of different forces in the system becomes more apparent.
    \item Many of the calculations in numerical algorithms happens at an order of about 1, which is desireable for decreasing round-off error due to finite machine precision.
\end{itemize}

The characteristic units are chosen as:
\begin{align}
    \text{Unit length: } k_r &= a_{\Earth}\ {\color{gray} \approx \SI{1.50e8}{\km} \text{(1 Earth orbit semi-major axis)}}  \\[0.2cm]
    \text{Unit time: } k_t &= T_{\Earth} = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_\Earth} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{a_\Earth^3}{G M_\Sun}}\ {\color{gray} \approx \SI{3.16e7}{\s} \text{ (1 year)}} \\[0.2cm]
    \text{Unit speed: } k_v &= \frac{k_r}{k_t} = \frac{a_\Earth \omega_\Earth}{2\pi} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{G M_\Sun}{a_\Earth}}\ {\color{gray} \approx \SI{4.74}{\km/\s}}
\end{align}
where \(a_\Earth\) is the semi-major axis of Earth's orbit in kilometers, see \cref{fig:earth-semi-major-axis}, \(T_\Earth\) is Earth's orbital period (i.e. 1 year) in seconds and the characteristic speed thus becomes Earth's average orbital speed with respect to the sun.

We don't need a characteristic mass \(m_s\) since the mass cancels out in the equations of motion for the quantity we care about, delta-v.

The unit for time is expressed in seconds because we found heuristically we needed time steps on the order of \(\SI{1}{\s}\) to maintain an error per step of about \num{10e-9}.

The unit for length is expressed in kilometers because it is customary to use \si{\km/\s} as unit of speed for celestial objects.

One can choose whichever of the two Symplectic Euler versions \cref{eq:symplectic-euler1,eq:symplectic-euler2} is easier to solve for the equations at hand. We choose the latter form \cref{eq:symplectic-euler2} so with our Hamiltonian \cref{eq:HH_m} we get
\begin{align}
    R_1 &= R_0 + h B_{r,0} \label{eq:symplectic-euler-R_1}, \\[0.4cm]

As we can see, we are lucky with this Hamiltonian since we can simply run all steps in the order above, \cref{eq:symplectic-euler-R_1,eq:symplectic-euler-theta_1,eq:symplectic-euler-phi_1,eq:symplectic-euler-Br_1,eq:symplectic-euler-Btheta_1,eq:symplectic-euler-Bphi_1} without needing to solve any implicit equations.

\section{Interplanetary Transfer Orbits}

\subsection{Transfer Orbit to Mars: 2D Patched Conic Approximation} \label{sec:2d-patched-conic}
Get get a sense of the initial conditions that will bring us on a transfer orbit from Earth to Mars, we are interested in the following key numbers:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Delta-v for Mars Orbit Insertion (MOI) at Earth.
	\item Delta-v for arrival into circular orbit at Mars.
	\item Relative positions of Earth and Mars for optimal Hohmann trajectory.
	\item Travel time for optimal Hohmann trajectory.
\end{enumerate}

Knowing this we have a first good guess on initial conditions to put into the interplanetary 3D simulator, for which we can search for optimal parameters nearby for some good low-delta-v trajectories to mars. To approximate these numbers we can use the \emph{patched conic approximation}.

First we recall that there are four possible orbit types in a two-body system that are all conic sections: circular, elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic (and the circular is actually a special case of the elliptic), see \cref{fig:conics-and-orbits}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \subfloat[Conic sections. The parabola is created from an intersecting plane parallel to the cone (Image: \cite{MagisterMathematicae} (modified)).]{
        \includegraphics[width=0.47\linewidth]{fig/Conic_Sections2.pdf}
        \label{fig:conic-sections}

    \caption{The four types of conic sections, corresponding to the four kinds of orbits for a two-body gravitational system. Some authors count three types, with the circle being a special case of the ellipse.}
    \label{fig:conics-and-orbits}
\end{figure}

These four orbit types are characterized by the orbit specific energy (mechanical energy per mass) or equivalently by the ranges of eccentricity, see table in \cref{tab:orbit-type-properties}. As the table shows, a negative mechanical energy corresponds to a closed orbit (either circular or elliptical), zero energy corresponds to a parabolic orbit, i.e. an escape velocity orbit that occurs when a satellite is moving with \emph{just} enough speed with respect to a central body that it's speed goes towards zero at infinity. Finally, positive mechanical energy corresponds to hyperbolic orbits.

\begin{table}[tbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
    \toprule
    Conic Section & Eccentricity    & Semi-major axis & Energy  \\ \midrule
    Circle        & $0$             & = radius        & $<0$    \\
    Ellipse       & $0 < e < 1$     & $>0$            & $<0$    \\
    Parabola      & 1               & infinity        & $0$     \\
    Hyperbola     & $>1$            & $<0$            & $>0$    \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Properties of the four orbit types, characterized by their specific energy and eccentricity (Source: \cite{Braeunig}).}
    \label{tab:orbit-type-properties}
\end{table}


For a interplanetary transfer orbit we can use the Hohmann transfer orbit as the ``base transfer orbit'' and make some modifications. We recall that the Hohmann transfer is an elliptical orbit that brings a satellite between two different circular orbits around a central body by applying an instantaneous burn twice as depicted back in \cref{fig:hohmann}. This assumes only one central body. However in our system, we have three central bodies of interest: Earth, Sun and Mars. Each is the dominant body at various points of the journey. We start in a circular orbit around Earth, burn into an elliptical orbit around the Sun and arrive to Mars, burning to a circular orbit again. We can model the transfer orbit to Mars by patching three conic sections:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Hyperbolic departure orbit (Geocentric reference frame).
	\item Elliptical transfer orbit (Heliocentric reference frame).
	\item Hyperbolic arrival orbit (Mars-centric reference frame).
\end{enumerate}
\cref{fig:Hohmann-to-mars-heliocentric} show necessary speeds on Hohmann orbit and the orbit speed of Earth and Mars. 
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{fig/Hohmann-to-mars-heliocentric.png}
    \caption{Hohmann transfer to Mars with necessary departure speed (periapsis at Earth) and arrival speed (apoapsis at Mars) on Hohmann orbit relative to Sun (Image: \cite[p.~127]{Rapp2016} (modified)).}
    \label{fig:Hohmann-to-mars-heliocentric}
\end{figure}
Why are the departure and arrival orbits modelled as hyperbolic? We need extra speed from LEO to enter a transfer orbit that intersects Mars, meaning we need some velocity in excess to escape velocity. Likewise we \emph{always} arrive at other bodies in a hyperbolic orbit as seen from that body; if we started with zero speed approaching from infinitely far away and waited for infinity, we would get the escape velocity when reaching the planet (this is just escaping with the exact escape velocity in reverse). But since we in practice always come speed already, relative to the body we approach (here Mars), we arrive with speed in excess to the escape velocity, hence along a hyperbolic orbit, as shown in table in \cref{tab:orbit-type-properties}.

As \cref{fig:Hohmann-to-mars-heliocentric} shows, we arrive at Mars' orbit with less speed than Mars \emph{if Mars wasn't there}, but actually need to slow down due to the attraction of Mars that results in higher speed to necessary for a close circular orbit at target altitude \SI{125}{\km}. Thus overall we get a hyperbolic departure orbit, patched with an elliptical orbit, patched with another hyperbolic arrival orbit, with required speeds as illustrated in figure \cref{fig:Hohmann-to-mars-geocentric-areocentric}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{fig/Hohmann-to-mars-geocentric-areocentric.png}
    \caption{Hohmann transfer to Mars with necessary departure, arrival and parking speeds relative to Earth on the left and Mars on the right (Image: \cite[p.~133]{Rapp2016} (modified)).}
    \label{fig:Hohmann-to-mars-geocentric-areocentric}
\end{figure}

All the numbers of \cref{fig:Hohmann-to-mars-heliocentric,fig:Hohmann-to-mars-geocentric-areocentric} are derived in \cref{apx:mars-hohmann-derivations}, answering our four questions from the beginning of the chapter:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \SI{3.62}{\km\per\s} needed to depart Earth circular orbit at altitude 160 km on Mars Orbit Insertion (MOI).
	\item \SI{-2.11}{\km\per\s} needed at Mars arrival for circular orbit at \SI{125}{\km} altitude. Just for illustration, we could also apply less burn at Mars at the expense of entering a highly elliptical orbit as \cref{fig:mars-arrival-orbit} shows.
	\item Mars must be $44^\degree$ behind Earth at MOI in order for Mars to be at Hohmann orbit apoapsis at the same time, see \cref{fig:Hohmann-angle}. This happens about every 26 months.
	\item Travel time for optimal Hohmann trajectory is around 260 days, or around 8.5 months.
\end{enumerate}

These numbers are an important approximate reference point to have when attempting to find low energy transfer orbits to Mars.

\subsection{Earth-Mars Transfer in 3D}
\subsubsection{Ignored Complications}
In the section above there are a number of complications that we have ignored. For example, Earth and Mars have different eccentricities (0.0167 vs. 0.0934) meaning that its angular velocity changes considerably depending on whether it is near perihelion or aphelion at the time of transfer. For a better estimate we can no longer consider the orbit to be circular. \cite{Braeuniga} gives a great analysis of the Earth-Mars Hohmann transfer orbit in 3D.


\subsubsection{Launch into The Right Plane – Actual Hohmann Transfer Orbit in 3D}
In the previous section we detailed the important patched conic sections model in 2D. In our 3D simulator we will attempt something similar, but take the inclination of Mars' orbital plane into account.

Mars orbital inclination is $1.85^\degree$ to the ecliptic plane. Therefore if one naively tried to rendezvous with Mars in the ecliptic plane it would be \( 1.52\ \text{AU} \cdot 1.85^\degree \pi / 180 = \SI{7.4e6}{\km} \) away. Instead we will attempt a 3D Hohmann transfer orbit as illustrated in \cref{fig:hohmann-transfer-orbit-3D} using the same launch parameters as was found in the 2D hohmann model in \cref{sec:2d-patched-conic}, but allowing the \(\phi\) angle to vary a bit to get slightly out of the plane.
