\chapter{Abstract}
We will examine computational Evolution Strategies (ES) as a possible search strategy for finding low energy transfer orbits to the Moon and Mars with an N-body problem simulator of our own design. Furthermore we apply good software engineering practices to ensure the correctness of our work and make it accessible for others in the future. Finally, we aim to parallelize the simulator for GPU to a given a level of performance that will let the simulator run with any optimizer, even ones like ES with many fitness evaluations.
