# Thesis description

When navigating a spacecraft between various orbits, low energy transfer orbits (LETOs) allows us to make the trade-off of a longer flight time in return for lower propellant energy requirements, suitable for unmanned space missions. In 2015 we explored the limits of LETOs from Earth to Moon using a simple restricted 3-body model with just two engine burns and GPU accelerated simulations. These simulations were searching the space for LETOs in a brute force manner, shooting out from low earth orbit in many random directions and velocity vectors. To validate the model and simulation, we were able to recreate the parameters of the Hohmann transfer orbit of the Apollo missions to within 2.5% $\Delta v$ and found some LETOs with some of the lowest $\Delta v$ values we have seen in the literature (see ***CITE PAPER HERE*). Now we want to explore the use of more intelligent optimization strategies, in particular evolution strategies, for finding LETOs. We also want to expand the model to explore LETOs to planet Mars.
