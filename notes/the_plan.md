# The Plan

## Oisin

- Equalize Raw rocketry & Cuda rocket.
- Play a little with `nIterations` vs. `nIndividuals` vs. `nJitter`

## Gandalf

- Make a random guesser function that has (`nIterations` * `nIndividuals` * `nJitter`) guesses and takes the best.
- Find a good fitness shaping of [success vs. fail run], rather than `(x+10)*10`

## Backlog
